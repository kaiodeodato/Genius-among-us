To start the game you need to choose a difficulty, each difficulty
provides a different time for the keys to be clicked.

When ready, you must click on the yellow button, and the round one will start.

At the beginning of the game, the program will generate a start button, randomly, that you must click after it,
knowing that in the first round a button will be shown, in the second round two buttons, in the third three buttons and so on.

After choosing the buttons you must wait for the program to inform you if you were right or not, this will happen after a few
seconds, when the yellow button turns green and will release a beep.

After this signal, you must click on the yellow button again to start round 2, as well as afterwards to
start from round 3 and so on.

When the player reaches the end, all the keys turn green and so, the game is over, and it is possible to play again
just refreshing the browser.

Thanks
and have fun!
